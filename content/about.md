We're a travelling hacker collective from Scotland who represent ourselves and
our country at events round the world.

We aim to provide a chilled out, primarily social workspace in the mania of
hacker camps and conferences for people to visit, stay, contribute to and
share.

We run Scottish themed events in partnerships with other villages / assemblies
we're friends with - whisky tastings, food nights, etc.
