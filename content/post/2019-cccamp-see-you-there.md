We're bringing the Scottish Consulate back to CCC Camp. We're going to be
around Milliways and should be identifiable from the Scottish flag. If you're
around, come say hi!

You don&rsquo;t have to be Scottish to be a member, we run a comprehensive <a href="https://scottishconsulate.org/fcku/overview#asylum">Asylum
program</a> for our
international friends and refugees of no fixed abode!

Perhaps you&rsquo;ll need a
<a href="https://scottishconsulate.org/fcku/overview#visitor_visa">Visa</a> - your
eligibility may be checked upon arrival at
the border.

You can always add your name to our event wiki page and you are welcome to camp
with/socialise with/party with us to your heart&rsquo;s content, but without
appropriate paperwork, we may be suspicious of your intentions.

If you have a need to contact a consular official during your time at CCC camp,
you can reach our switchboard on DECT 7222 or call us via amateur radio on
433.550MHz FM.
