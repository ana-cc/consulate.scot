At [CampGND 2019](https://scottishconsulate.org/campgnd2019/overview) we
operated a special event station GB1GND. There were quite a few amateur radio
operators present.

Between us we had a few HF radios, various data cables, and laptops.

For the most part we were using the [Sotabeams three-band portable dipole
antenna system
(20/30/40m)](https://www.sotabeams.co.uk/band-hopper-iii-three-band-linked-dipole/) on a 7 meter telescopic pole.

We attempted to do some APRS on 30 meters but were unable to get everything set
up due to really a RF noisy USB soundcard preventing anything from working. In
the process though, we did try out using
[direwolf](https://github.com/wb2osz/direwolf) with
[hamlib](https://hamlib.github.io/) for PTT control. As a result of this, this
mode of operation [is now
built](https://tracker.debian.org/news/1043302/accepted-direwolf-15dfsg-2-source-into-unstable/)
into the [Debian package](https://packages.debian.org/bullseye/direwolf).

You can find the logbook from the event here: [GB1GND @ CampGND 2019](/log/2019-gb1gnd-campgnd.adif).
